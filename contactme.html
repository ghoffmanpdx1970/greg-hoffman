	<div><p><strong>Update: October 29, 2017.</strong>Well, I'm back in Fremont after our trip to Indiana. I did get a few things accomplished while we were
											in Indiana. However, getting back to California and moving on into Javascript has proven to be too much for me to tackle using only
											my tablet. So, my new 17" HP Laptop will be here Monday, and I'm probably going to be spending most of the time after I get it setting
											it up to how I want/need it.</p>
											<p> Also, taking a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a> has proven to be rather troublesome. First of all, I am 
											hard of hearing and having Closed Captions (CC) helps a lot, as long as the CC actually matches what's being said. Then, Udemy allows
											you to download the entire course, but it will randomly show lectures as not being dodwnloaded. The most frustrating thing, to me,
											is that when I try to go back to a lecture that I didn't even complete the app will force me to continue on to the next lecture. Not a 
											major problem <strong>IF</strong> the website is working, which it wasn't.</p>
											<p>First on my plate will be to completely remove Windows 10 and install Linux. I'm a little torn about doing this. Not because I prefer
											Windows, I don't. But, I was thinking of being able to install Virtual Machines (VMs) for different Linux versions, etc. In thinking about it,
											though, it would be better to use Linux as my dev platform and install Windows in a VM. I started this path using Linux, and I'm much
											more comfortable doing it that way than with Windows. I got used to using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>
											on Linux. But, I'm not entirely sure about paying $80 for it. I've been using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.welant.webmaster&hl=en&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dwebmaster%27s+html+editor+for+linux&pcampaignid=APPU_1_DcH0WbH7AcKQ0wLRkrzQCQ"</a>Webmaster's HTML Editor</a> on my tablet, but there isn't a version for Linux. So, I will
											probably just pay the $80 for Sublime Text. We'll see...</p>
											<p>I'm thinking that maybe it will be helpful to document my entire dev environment setup from start to finish. Take pictures of the
											laptop when I get it, document the specs, Linux distro and version, dev tools installed and how/where I got them. Just take it from start
											to finish. Should also help me with getting a little more experience with web dev.</p></div>

	<div>	<p><strong>Update: October 15, 2017 #2.</strong>Got the navbar sorted out. It was kind of a mess, but I'm much happier with it, now. Added this blog
									page so I can remove some stuff off of the index page and start separating and organizing everything into better sized blurbs. Also, started
									to work on the "About Me" page. I know I'm putting in way too much stuff, right now. But, it will help me to better narrow down and condense
									to what's actually important to put on here.</p></div>
	
	<hr>	
	<div>	<p><strong> Update: October 15, 2017.</strong> Ok, I added the navbar to the top, created containers for the navbar and for the main text of this page. I
									added the jquery and bootstrap.js links into the file, as well. It's 1am, right now, so I'm going to get some sleep and then work on this some
									more later.</p></div>

	<div>	<p><strong>Update: October 14, 2017.</strong> I really haven't made much progress. Between work and the fact that I tend to get a little too easily
									 sidetracked with
									other things that I'm trying to learn, I sometimes lose focus on the things that I'm doing for me! However, I am going to attempt to recitfy this
									with a few small things that I feel that I can accomplsh this weekend in order to feel like I can enjoy a little success in my life, and take 
									myself seriously as a junior/entry-level web developer. Of course, the majority of it will be restricted to HTML5 and CSS.</p></div>
